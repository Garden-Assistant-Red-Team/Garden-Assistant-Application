# The Problem

Many beginner gardeners struggle with maintaining healthy plants due to lack of consistent care, weather changes, and lack of plant-specific knowledge.  
Our project aims to solve this by creating a digital assistant that helps track plant care tasks and environmental conditions.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Forgetting to water or fertilize plants.
- Not knowing each plantâ€™s specific needs.
- Difficulty tracking seasonal changes.
- Lack of consolidated gardening advice.
