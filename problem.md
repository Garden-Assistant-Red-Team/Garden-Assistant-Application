# Problem Statement
Many new homeowners and first-time gardeners struggle to keep their plants alive and healthy because they lack accessible, reliable guidance on plant care. 
Existing information is scattered across blogs and videos, making it difficult to find consistent, beginner-friendly advice. 
This leads to frustration, wasted money, and a loss of motivation to continue gardening.
