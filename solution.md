The platform provides **recommendations for planting, watering, and maintenance** based on the userâ€™s **location, climate, and soil type**.  
Users receive **real-time weather alerts** to plan watering and other care tasks, and they can **track pests or diseases** in their area.  
Garden Assistant also helps users find and recommend plants suited to their environment and keeps track of plant health through notes and reminders.
